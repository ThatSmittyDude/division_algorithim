# division_algorithim
A code to learn how optimize c++. Please feel free to help make this run faster!
I'm just a hobbyist learning c++ I'm sure a real dev could make a much faster program. 

Overview:
  division4.cpp is a simple implementation of division in c++14 as a control.
  division3.cpp is an algorithim that I wrote to try and beat the compiler!
  Any division3.#.cpp is a newer version of the algorithtim.
  The full benchmarks are located in the /full_benchmark directory.
  
  All files went through g++ and generated assembly so I can learn what the compiler is doing.
  The files that are compiled this way are just a single cycle of the algorithim.
  Single cycle files are located in the /single_cycle directory.

  So far the compiler is wining, but I have gotten division3.cpp to be pretty quick.
  Id like to keep the accuracy 0.1 or less away from the correct answer

  The variables are assigned at the beginning of the program to make timing easier in the shell

  Please do whatever you would like to the program and feel free to fill me in!

  Updates:
    division3.3.cpp is super fast. The compiler for division4.cpp wins most of the time.
    division3.3.cpp isn't as accurite as I'd like it to be so feel free to help me solve that.
