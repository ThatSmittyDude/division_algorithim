# division_algorithim
A code to learn how optimize c++. Please feel free to help make this run faster!
I'm just a hobbyist learning c++, so I'm sure a real dev could make a much faster program. 

Overview:
  division4.cpp is a simple implementation of division in c++14 as a control.
  division3.cpp is an algorithim that I wrote to try and beat the compiler!

  So far the compiler is wining, but I have gotten division3.cpp to be pretty quick.
  Id like to keep the accuracy 0.1 or less away from the correct answer

  The variables are assigned at the beginning of the program to make timing easier in the shell

  Please do whatever you would like to the program and feel free to fill me in!
